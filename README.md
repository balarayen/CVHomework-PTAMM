# PTAMM (Modified for our computer vision homework)

Original version fetched from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~bob/research/research_ptamm.html

## Our changes

* Model game: model self rotate.
* New Video game: play video in the scene
* Detect marker when initializing to determine the initial scene scale and location
* reproduceable build process on Ubuntu 18.04. (as a Dockerfile) This software is developed on Ubuntu 9.04. It is a little hard to get it compiled now.
